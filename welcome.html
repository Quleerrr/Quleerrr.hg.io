                <h3>Gender</h3>
                <p id="Gender1">Traditional Maori society had defined roles for men and women, with women often taking on responsibilities related to family and domestic affairs, while men were involved in hunting, warfare, and leadership. However, Maori culture also has a strong tradition of respecting women and their contributions. In contemporary Maori society, there is a growing emphasis on gender equality and the recognition of women's rights.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Class</h3>
                <p id="Class1">Historically, Maori society had a hierarchical structure based on tribal affiliations and chiefly status. However, with colonization and subsequent socio-economic changes, traditional class distinctions have become less prominent. Today, there are still disparities in socio-economic status among Maori communities, but efforts are being made to address these through initiatives promoting education, employment, and economic development.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <p id="Religion1">Traditional Maori religion, known as Te Ao Mārama (The World of Light), involves a complex system of spiritual beliefs and practices centered around the worship of ancestors, nature, and deities. With the arrival of European settlers, Christianity was introduced to Maori communities and has since become widely practiced alongside traditional beliefs. Maori spirituality continues to play a significant role in cultural ceremonies and rituals.</p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Ethnicity</h3>
                <p id="Ethnicity1">Maori culture places a strong emphasis on kinship, community, and belonging. Identity and ethnicity are closely tied to ancestry and whakapapa (genealogy) within Maori society. </p>
